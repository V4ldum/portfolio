### About the project

This website was built because I wanted to have an easy way to create and store bingo tables. We sometime create them with friend during events, and the only alternative were shady websites on the internet. The project enables me to create them and keep them stored for as long as I want. All bingos are available publicly provided that you have the correct URL, but you need to authenticate yourself to create, update or check cells in a bingo. Each bingo refreshes itself automatically if a cell is checked or unchecked so that anybody currently on a page will have a live update.

The website was deployed on my personal VPS and is often being used.
