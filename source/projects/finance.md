### About the project

I built this application to have a centralized summary of my finance portfolio. For that, I use (Finary)[https://finary.com]'s API for accounts' data, and a custom Rust API for other data like coins and cash. The app aggregates data from both of those sources and categorize them for me to have an overview of everything I own.

### Tech Stack

- **Front-end:** Flutter
- **State management:** Riverpod
- **Back-end:** Custom API in Rust, Finary's API
- **Design:** Material
