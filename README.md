# Portfolio

This is the source code for the static code generator for my portfolio. 
You can find it [here](https://portfolio.valdum.dev).

## Generating

Files are available inside the `build` folder after generation.

```
dart run bin/main.dart <mocks|templating>
```

**mocks**: This argument will only construct the source code of the mocks to enable testing.
**release**: This argument will build the portfolio and all mocked projects. If not in release, only the portfolio will be built, not the mocked projects.
