### About the project

This is my first ever Flutter app. I built this to get started in learning Flutter. I built a very small API in Rust to query data asynchronously and style that data inside the app. The stopwatch was created by myself using a *CustomPainter* and trigonometry (gasp). I sure did not expect to use trigonometry this late after high school, and absolutely not in a mobile application! The application doesn't do anything fancy, it's just a fake workout program with different types of exercices. Since this was my first ever app, I used *Provider* for state management. This was before learning about the wonders of *Riverpod*.

### Tech Stack

- **Front-end:** Flutter
- **State management:** Provider
- **Back-end:** Custom API in Rust

### Demonstration

You can use a demo version of this app by clicking on the button below. Everything outside the app is simulated in your browser which means there is no way for you to mess anything up in the app. Please poke around to see what it does ! Keep in mind that as this was really just a test app, a lot of things are placeholders and just not implemented.

The credentials are mock:mock.
