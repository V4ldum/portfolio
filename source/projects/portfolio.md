### About the project

My portfolio (the website you are currently browsing) is a static website built using [StaticShock](https://staticshock.io/). When changes are made, the StaticShock pipeline runs once and created all HTML files from Markdown content and builds all my projects in demo mode.

I am able to ship demos of my apps because I use Flutter, which supports building an application for the web, as well as Riverpod for state management, which makes mocking external calls easy. Because Flutter Web is not perfect, you will sometime find small bugs or inconsistencies with my demos. Those issues are not there when targeting a mobile device.

You can find the source code for the pipeline as well as the markdown files [here](https://github.com/V4ldum/portfolio).
